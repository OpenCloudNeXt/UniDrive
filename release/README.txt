Requirements

.Net 4.0 or higher.


Overview

UniDrive is a consumer multi-cloud application that synergizes multiple consumer 
cloud storage services (CCSs) like Dropbox and OneDrive to provide more reliable 
and secure file storage as well as faster multi-device synchronization services.

UniDrive provides the same interface as a CCS application such as Dropbox, 
automatically synchronizes files in your local sync folder to multiple CCSs, and then to your other devices.

Setup and Authentication

Unpack and double click UniDrive.exe to start the application. You need to specify the 
sync folder location and use your CCS accounts to authenticate at least
 3 clouds to make UniDrive work. 

Specifically, click the corresponding icon to open a web browser to 
authenticate each cloud (or create new accounts). After you enter your user 
name and password in the CCS's website and confirm the authentication, the
 browser will be closed and the cloud will be marked by a ¡Ì, indicating the 
success of authentication.


Normal Usage

After the authentication you will see a loading page initializing the cloud
environment, and then a window to show information about:

	1) Your local sync folder in UniDrive and files in each cloud.
	
	2) Uploading/downloading files.
	
	3) Historical records.

	4) Cloud accounts you own.

You can put files into the sync folders to let them automatically be uploaded to
multi-cloud.


Setup on Other Devices

Once you have setup UniDrive in one device, it will be much more convenient to 
deploy it to other devices. You only need to authenticate one cloud, and other clouds will automatically be authenticated. 
After that files will be synchronized across your devices automatically.


Exit

Close the window won't exit the application, UniDrive maintains a system tray to
continuously monitor local sync folder, right click the tray and click exit to
exit the application.


Trace Collection and Privacy Issue

UniDrive collects performance traces (not user files) for academic research and software improvement. 
Including but not limited to metrics such as file size and data transfer speed. 
No data content or user credential are accessed.  You can remove all your 
UniDrive data in the multi-cloud as well as the local cache by running Uninstall.exe.
