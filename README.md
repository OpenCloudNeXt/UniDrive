# UniDrive
Without vendor lock-in, UniDrive is a multi-clouds unified framework and a server-less/client-centric application that synergizes multiple consumer cloud storage services (CCSs) like Dropbox and Microsoft OneDrive, in order to provide more reliable and secure file storage/backup as well as extremely faster multi-devices synchronization and file distribution/sharing and even convenient file migration services.
UniDrive not only enhances the reliability and security by judiciously distributing erasure-coded files across multiple clouds (i.e., no single cloud can have user data in integrity, and survive cloud outages), but also achieves uniform-view and consistent access experience across different geo-locations and over time (i.e., faster than any single cloud) by masking network fluctuations and boosting networking performance through maximizing parallel transfer opportunities and exploiting more the faster cloud.
UniDrive is a solid proof-of-concept of open and interoperable Inter-clouds vision.
